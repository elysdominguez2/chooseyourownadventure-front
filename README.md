## Welcome!

This is a tourism app where you are the protagonist and you own your destination during the itinerary.

I based my app on a book I read as a child. In which you have a bunch of different endings. So now the same with this app. The itinerary is not the same for you as it is for me, because we can choose a different route.

## Workflow

I created two repositories [Backend](https://github.com/elysdominguez2/chooseyourownadventure-back) and [Frontend](https://github.com/elysdominguez2/chooseyourownadventure-front)
I also deployed the Frontend in [Netlify](https://choose-your-own-adventure-app.netlify.app/) soon Backend deploy.

## Wireframe:

In the begining I designed the user story and the [Mockflow](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/chooseyourownadventure) to have a reference.

### Frontend tools

I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework with [Redux](https://es.redux.js.org/) to control the global state. I did the CSS with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and vainilla CSS for the animation. [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for the icons. I consulted the api [Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for the maps.

### Backend tools

I used [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) as framework. Also I used [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the models.
